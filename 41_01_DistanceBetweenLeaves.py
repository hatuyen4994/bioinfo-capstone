In this chapter, we define the length of a path in a tree as the sum of the lengths of its edges (rather than the number of edges 
on the path). As a result, the evolutionary distance between two present-day species corresponding to leaves i and j in a tree T is 
equal to the length of the unique path connecting i and j, denoted di,j(T).

Distances Between Leaves Problem: Compute the distances between leaves in a weighted tree.
     Input:  An integer n followed by the adjacency list of a weighted tree with n leaves.
     Output: An n x n matrix (di,j), where di,j is the length of the path between leaves i and j.

Code Challenge: Solve the Distances Between Leaves Problem. The tree is given as an adjacency list of a graph whose leaves are 
integers between 0 and n - 1; the notation a->b:c means that node a is connected to node b by an edge of weight c. The matrix 
you return should be space-separated.

Sample Input:
4
0->4:11
1->4:2
2->5:6
3->5:7
4->0:11
4->1:2
4->5:4
5->4:4
5->3:7
5->2:6
Sample Output:
0	13	21	22
13	0	12	13
21	12	0	13
22	13	13	0
