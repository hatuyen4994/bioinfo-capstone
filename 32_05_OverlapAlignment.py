'''
An overlap alignment of strings v = v1 ... vn and w = w1 ... wm is a global alignment of a suffix of v with a prefix of w. An optimal 
overlap alignment of strings v and w maximizes the global alignment score between an i-suffix of v and a j-prefix of w (i.e., between 
vi ... vn and w1 ... wj) among all i and j.

Overlap Alignment Problem: Construct a highest-scoring overlap alignment between two strings.
     Input: Two strings and a matrix score.
     Output: A highest-scoring overlap alignment between the two strings as defined by the scoring matrix score.

Sample Input:
     PAWHEAE
     HEAGAWGHEE

Sample Output:
     1
     HEAE
     HEAG
